# CHIRP-Birdsong-Recognition Project 

# Project Overview:
Welcome to CHIRP: Bird Call Recognition Project repository. Project is dedicated to developing an efficient and accurate bird call recognition system. The primary objective is to enable the identification of bird species based on their unique vocalizations.

Problem Statement : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XcudozGX8jViYwwwWl1akXFnJSMr8lQqCnmJbYCuMso/edit

# Approach:
The 'Chirp' project aims to harness advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques and build a precise and efficient ML system that empowers users to identify bird species through their unique vocalizations. We will analyze patterns in our audio data (EDA), extract unique features (FE) from it that help differentiate one birdcall from another, remove any background noise and build a neural network model that will enable the classification of bird species.

# Tech Stacks:
1. Programming languages:
   Python
2. Libraries and Frameworks:
   NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Librosa, Sci-kit learn, PyTorch/Tensorflow
3. Tools:
   Jupyter Notebook/ Google Colab, Kaggle

# Task Flow:
1. Working with Libraries:
   Acquired proficiency in NumPy for numerical operations, mastered Pandas for efficient
   data manipulation and analysis and developed skills in data visualization using
   Matplotlib and Seaborn.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   Initiate a thorough EDA of CSV files for data cleaning, preprocessing, and
   relationship exploration. Identify and address outliers to ensure data integrity.

3. Feature Extraction (FE) from Audio Files:
   Developed skills in Librosa library to conduct Feature Extraction from audio files,
   capturing beats per minute, spectrograms, zero-crossing rates, band energy ratios,
   and other important features with the aim to help distinguish unique acoustic
   signatures for different bird species.

4. Machine Learning Model Development:
   Utilize various machine learning models for bird species classification based on
   extracted audio features. Evaluate model performance metrics to determine the most
   effective algorithm.

5. Performance Evaluation:
   Assess model performance across different algorithms, emphasizing accuracy,
   precision, recall, and F1 score. Identify optimal models and analyze their robustness
   in handling diverse birdcall patterns.
